Prophet is open source software released by Facebook’s Core Data Science team.

Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects.

Prophet works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data.

Data represents weekly 2018 retail scan data for National retail volume (units) and price.
Retail scan data comes directly from retailers’ cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados.
The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost, even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags.
The Product Lookup codes (PLU’s) in the table are only for Hass avocados. Other varieties of avocados (e.g. greenskins) are not included in this table.
